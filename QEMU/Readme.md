# QEMU

BOS can also be run using QEMU (for those that are familiar with it). For those that are not familiar, QEMU is a hypervisor (much like VirtualBox, VMware and Parallels) used to run virtual machines.  Using the same disk image (bos.vhd), you can also run BOS within QEMU.

## Why Use QEMU
Choosing between VirtualBox vs QEMU is totally up to the user. Most developers are familiar with QEMU and prefer it. Some developers are familiar with VirtualBox. The advnatage of QEMU is that it is light and runs from a commandline, which allows developers to create scripts. VirtualBox is good in that it has a GUI interface and is easier to configure. If you are new or less experienced, start with VirtualBox. If want a little more control from a commandline, go with QEMU. Either way, it depends on whatever works best for you.
