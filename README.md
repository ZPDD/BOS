# BOS
Build a Better Operating System.

That first sentence basically says it all. The intent of this project is; if you were to create an Operating System (OS) from scratch, what would you do to make it better? What would you put in? And, just as important; what would you leave out?

- 

BOS is an stripped down OS (and platform) to allow a developers to create applications on top without having to deal with complexities of the OS or platform you are using. To make it as easy as possible to use to bring your application (or system) to life.
