# BOS
Build a Better Operating System.

That first sentence basically says it all. The intent of this project is; if you were to create an Operating System (OS) from scratch, what would you do to make it better? What would you put in? And just as important; what would you leave out?

What makes BOS unique:
BOS is a stripped down OS (and platform) to allow a developers to create applications without having to deal with complexities of the OS or platform you are using. To make it as easy as possible to use to bring your application (or system) to life. It is small; leaving resources for the application. It is fast; BOS will startup in a few seconds (even from a USB stick). It is a platform to create purpose specific applications, this give the developer an ability to setup an environment that does what the developer wants without having to lock down an OS or remove functions from the OS.

What BOS is not:
It is not a general purpose OS. It is not meant for people to read emails, browse the Internet, create documents, create presentations, etc. There are other OS' that do this and do this very well. 

BOS is meant to be the base platform for a product. BOS would be a great solution for Internet of Things (IoT) as many of those products are meant to develiver very specific tasks. Any solution that is meant to deliver specifics results, BOS would be the platform to use.

- built from scratch
- transparency, everything is shown.
